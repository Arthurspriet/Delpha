For this challenge, my approach was to find the easiest and lightest way to scrape the required data. 
I only use the Wikipedia API and the Google search API to collect the data.

Once the data was scrapped I made a map visualization using Tableau and I also made a map using folium. 

You can find both in this repo.

To visualize the folium map I would advice downloading the file "map.html" and opening it in a browser. 

This repo contains the script used to scrape, to make the map, the data in a CSV file and a Tableau file.
